This Node.js code creates a simple HTTP server that listens on port 3000 and reads a log file (logfile.txt) when a request is received. 
This code requires two built-in Node.js modules to be installed: "fs" and "http".
The 'fs' module provides an API for working with the file system, including reading and writing files.
The 'http' module provides an API for creating HTTP servers and handling incoming requests.
To run npm install in the project directory.
Start the server by running 'node app.js' in the project directory.
Once the server is running, you can access it by navigating to "http://localhost:3000" in a web browser.
